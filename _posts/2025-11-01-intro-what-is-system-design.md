This post introduces the system design series. Use this page as the entry point to the HLD→LLD series and reference for basic concepts.

## Who should read this

- Junior engineers preparing for design interviews.
- Mid-level engineers learning to make trade-offs and design systems for scale.
- Engineering leads who want concise patterns and implementation guidance.

## What we'll cover in this series

- High-level architecture patterns (HLD) and low-level implementation (LLD).
- Practical examples, checklists, and diagrams.
- Case studies and postmortems.

## How to use this series

- Follow the recommended order (intro → fundamentals → patterns → case studies).
- Use the templates provided for HLD and LLD writeups.
- Contribute via GitHub issues or PRs (see the contributing guide).

## Quick glossary

- HLD — High Level Design: components, data flow, trade-offs.
- LLD — Low Level Design: APIs, data models, code-level decisions.

## Next

We'll publish a short primer on scalability fundamentals next week. Subscribe (or watch the repo) to get notified when drafts are published.
