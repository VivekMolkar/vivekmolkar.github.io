## What is Threadsmith?

Threadsmith is a small tool that helps write clean, readable X (Twitter) threads  
without breaking the writer’s thinking flow.

It’s intentionally minimal.

No rich formatting.  
No heavy UI.  
Just structure, clarity, and predictable output.


## Why I Built This

Writing a good thread looks simple, but it isn’t.

While writing, you constantly:
- break thoughts across tweets
- count characters
- reformat manually
- lose momentum mid-thought

Most tools try to solve this by adding features.

I wanted to explore the opposite approach:
> **remove friction instead of adding capability.**


## Constraints I Designed With

This work was shaped more by constraints than by features.

I optimized for:

- **Fast feedback**  
  Output should be visible immediately.

- **Minimal UI**  
  Nothing that pulls attention away from thinking.

- **Predictable behavior**  
  Formatting should never surprise the user.

- **Low cognitive load**  
  Stay in writing mode, not editing mode.

These constraints guided every decision.


## Key Design Decisions

Some choices were very deliberate:

- Kept the editor simple instead of feature-rich  
- Avoided persistence initially to reduce friction  
- Optimized for thinking flow, not customization  
- Chose clarity over flexibility  

The result is a smaller tool — but a calmer one.


## What This Work Focuses On

Threadsmith is not about scale.

It’s about:
- product thinking
- decision-making under constraints
- finishing something usable
- learning through execution

It’s a reminder that:
> **small systems still deserve thoughtful design.**


## What I’d Revisit Today

With distance, a few improvements are clear:

- Better separation between editor logic and formatting logic  
- Add lightweight analytics *after* validating usage patterns  
- Introduce persistence only if it clearly adds value  

These aren’t regrets — they’re markers of learning.


## Why This Belongs Under “Work”

Threadsmith reflects how I like to approach problems:

- start small
- respect constraints
- avoid premature complexity
- ship something real
- reflect honestly

It’s not a large system —  
but it shows how I think.
