As a software developer, I have a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. My expertise lies in writing software using various languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Angular, Objective-C and Swift.

I started my career as an iOS developer, where I gained proficiency in Objective-C and Swift. My interest in web development led me to explore Node.js and Angular, which I have been using extensively in my recent projects.

In addition to that, I have hands-on experience with AWS, which has enabled me to develop, deploy and scale applications on the cloud.

I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I am confident that my skills and experiences make me a valuable asset in any software development team.
