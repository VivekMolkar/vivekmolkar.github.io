As a driven software developer, I am passionate about crafting cutting-edge and efficient solutions that make an impact. My name is Vivek Molkar and I possess a wide range of skills in various programming languages and frameworks, including Node.js, Angular, Objective-C, and Swift.

I began my career as an iOS developer, where I honed my expertise in Objective-C and Swift, and later expanded my knowledge to the world of web development through my work with Node.js and Angular. With my hands-on experience using AWS, I am able to develop, deploy, and scale applications in the cloud with ease.

Constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth, I am confident in my ability to bring a diverse skill set and a passion for learning to any software development team. I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of new technologies and continuing to expand my knowledge base.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong collaborator and communicator. I have a track record of working effectively in cross-functional teams and have the ability to translate complex technical concepts into simple and understandable terms.

I am also a problem solver at heart and have a knack for finding creative solutions to complex challenges. I am driven by a desire to continuously improve and optimize the processes and systems I work with.

Furthermore, I have a deep appreciation for the user experience and always keep the end-user in mind when designing and developing software. This has helped me deliver high-quality, user-friendly products that meet the needs of the target audience.

Overall, I am confident that my technical abilities, team-oriented mindset, and passion for software development make me a valuable asset to any organization. If you are interested in connecting, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/vivekmolkar">@vivekmolkar</a>.
