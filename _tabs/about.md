I'm Vivek Molkar (विवेक मोळकर), a software engineer passionate about building resilient, scalable systems that solve real problems. With several years in backend and distributed systems development, I've evolved from hands-on coding in languages like Swift, Node.js, and Python to focusing on architectural trade-offs and mental models that make complex systems intuitive.

My journey started with iOS apps and web development (using frameworks like Angular and Express), where I honed skills in efficient, user-centric solutions. Over time, I've dived deeper into cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS for deployment and scaling) and now specialize in distributed systems — things like consistency models, replication, sharding, and resilience patterns. I believe great engineering isn't about tools; it's about understanding pressures, trade-offs, and when to keep things simple.

This blog, especially the "System Design Foundations" series, is my way of sharing those "aha" moments. I write short, reflective pieces to help engineers (from juniors to seniors) avoid common traps, build better intuition, and think in first-principles. No fluff — just clear explanations with mini exercises to apply ideas immediately.

Key qualities that drive my work:
- Collaborative problem-solver: Thrive in cross-functional teams, translating tech concepts simply.
- Lifelong learner: Always exploring new challenges in scalability, reliability, and optimization.
- User-focused: Prioritize end-user experience while balancing performance and correctness.
- Creative optimizer: Enjoy finding elegant solutions to thorny distributed problems.

I'm based in India and love discussing system design war stories. Connect with me on X [@vivekmolkar](https://twitter.com/vivekmolkar) or drop a note if you'd like to collaborate, share feedback, or just chat tech.

Thanks for reading — let's build better systems together.
